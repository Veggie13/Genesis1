=== Project Settings ===

This file describes the project settings for building Ambience using the
supplied Code::Blocks project file.

Compiler
--------

On all platforms, Ambience is meant to be built with GCC. On Windows, the
project has been built using MinGW 3.4.5 g++.

3rd-Party SDKs
--------------

Ambience uses two external products: Qt by Trolltech, and BASS by Un4seen.
It is targetted for Qt 4.x (4.3.0+) and BASS 2.4.x. Both are available
for Windows and Mac targets.

BASS is included as an external reference in the Subversion repository
for Ambience, as well as a C++ wrapper library (bass_cpp, precompiled).
Qt can be downloaded, but its paths must be stored as variables in the
IDE.

IDE
---

The project is supplied with a Code::Blocks project file. It has been
preconfigured for Windows and Mac build platforms. The IDE will need to
be set up with some environment settings for the project to find all
necessary components.

In Code::Blocks, go to Settings->Global Variables... and create a
variable called "qt4". The base will be the root path to your Qt install.
If there is no folder named "include" in your Qt install, it will also
have to be entered. It should be referenced relative to the base if
possible; the format is:

$(#qt)/<include path>

The same may need to be done for the library path if there is no "lib"
folder.

The following include and lib paths must be made as user-defined fields:

qtcoredir - the path to the QtCore include folder
            e.g. $(#qt4.include)/QtCore
qtguidir  - the path to the QtGui include folder
qtxmldir  - the path to the QtXml include folder
qtcorelib - the name of the QtCore library
            e.g. QtCore4
qtguilib  - the name of the QtGui library
qtxmllib  - the name of the QtXml library

The project references these variables in order to generalize the
project file to work on any system in either platform target.

On Windows, a further variable must exist called "debug_help". The
base must point to a location such that the following exists:

$(#debug_help.lib)\DbgHelp.Lib

Add a path to debug_help called "name".

name      - DbgHelp

This should allow Windows linking.
