| Ambience Sound Studio |
\-----------------------/


=== Version 1.1 ===

Rev 05 Beta
-----------

Bug Fixes:
- On a new project, or whenever there are no scenes created, the user was able to try and make
  new states, or delete the current scene. A crash was occurring on this nonsense event.


Rev 04 Beta
-----------

Bug Fixes:
- Pausing, saving, and reloading in the Random section was causing the sound to fail to start.
- Selecting a period less than the random sound length could cause it to be cut off.

New Features:
- Implemented second sound mode for Random where you select a multiple of the base sound length
  instead of a time in seconds.


Rev 03 Beta
-----------

Bug Fixes:
- If you cancel during the naming phase of file import, it would import anyway.

New Features:
- The hidable sidebar now has vertical scroll. Accordingly, the application no longer enforces
  maximization, allowing normal window resizing.
- Added Rename and Reimport options. Imported files can be given a new title, or current titles
  can be reassigned to new import files.
- Mute has been renamed to Pause on all controls to avoid confusion.


Rev 02 Beta
-----------

Bug Fixes:
- When trying to delete multiple items in Background or Random, some items were not being deleted.
- Upon creating new scenes, sometimes they would not appear in the drop-down list.
- If deleting the state currently being viewed, clicking Switch caused the program to crash.

New Features:
- Right-clicking on an assigned button in the Sound Board now gives a context menu for reassignment.
- The program now allows you to open a project file directly, and the installer associates the file
  extension .assp with Ambience.


Rev 01 Beta
-----------

Bug Fixes:
- Changing scenes and states in the dialog does not update the main drop-down menus.
