Bug Fixes:

- Upon creating new scenes, sometimes they would not appear in the drop-down list.
- If deleting the state currently being viewed, clicking Switch caused the program to crash.

New Features:
- Right-clicking on an assigned button in the Sound Board now gives a context menu for reassignment.
