=== Version 1.1 ===

Rev 03 Beta
-----------

Bug Fixes:
- If you cancel during the naming phase of file import, it would import anyway.


Rev 02 Beta
-----------

Bug Fixes:
- When trying to delete multiple items in Background or Random, some items were not being deleted.
- Upon creating new scenes, sometimes they would not appear in the drop-down list.
- If deleting the state currently being viewed, clicking Switch caused the program to crash.

New Features:
- Right-clicking on an assigned button in the Sound Board now gives a context menu for reassignment.
- The program now allows you to open a project file directly, and the installer associates the file
  extension .assp with Ambience.


Rev 01 Beta

Bug Fixes:
- Changing scenes and states in the dialog does not update the main drop-down menus.
