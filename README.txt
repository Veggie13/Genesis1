| Ambience Sound Studio |
| v1.1 rev02 beta       |
\-----------------------/


Bug Fixes:
- When trying to delete multiple items in Background or Random, some items were not being deleted.
- Upon creating new scenes, sometimes they would not appear in the drop-down list.
- If deleting the state currently being viewed, clicking Switch caused the program to crash.

New Features:
- Right-clicking on an assigned button in the Sound Board now gives a context menu for reassignment.
- The program now allows you to open a project file directly, and the installer associates the file
  extension .assp with Ambience.
